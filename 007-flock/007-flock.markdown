# Flock (2006/3/30)

Well, it's not much of a name, and it is still pretty much alpha stage, but the new <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a> browser looks very promising.

Based on <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla</a>, it seems to be trying to build itself around webservices, which means a more interactive way of using the web. I'm writing this post in the Flock editor now, and there is built-in support of services such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>. Not that all that isn't possible from, say, Firefox with a few extensions. It's just a new, integrated approach which may make some web-based applications more immediately useable for a range of people.

One thing -- writing and posting this was pretty quick and easy.

It will be interesting to watch.
