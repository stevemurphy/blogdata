# Windows is 21 - and MS-DOS is alive! (2006/11/23)

I’ve just started reading <a href="http://doggdot.us/">doggdot</a> (which I really like), and I read yesterday the news that <a href="http://www.mstechtoday.com/2006/11/20/microsoft-windows-is-21-years-old-today/">Microsoft Windows has just turned 21</a> (20 Nov 2006).

Kind of scary, because it reminded me I was using Windows 1.0 in 1986 -- almost from its birth. And I’m still using it now (mostly not by choice, though).

But, just now, using Windows XP, I was trying to copy a largish file (about 700MB), and I got an error which said “Invalid MS-DOS function”.

**Huh? MS-DOS?** I thought Microsoft said they had left all that behind in NT (**N**ew **T**echnology, after all) and XP and all that...

_(Fortunately my Mac had no problem copying the file -- nice to know that *nix, even older than MS-DOS, is still going strong!)_
