# Performancing (2006/04/08)

One of the reasons I keep this blog is to keep up with -- and try out -- blogging technology. My earlier post about Flock is an example. <i>This </i>post is a test of a <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">Firefox extension</a> from <a href="http://performancing.com/">Performancing</a>, which allows you to blog directly from within Firefox. Very simple, works well, and great for those times when you are surfing and something worth blogging comes to mind.

<a href="http://performancing.com/">Performancing</a> also offer a blog site statistics tool, which is free and worth checking out.
