# The Real Me (2007/06/23)

I've noticed that a lot of my <a href="http://smurph.jaiku.com">jaiku</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/smurph">twitter</a> presence posts are about coffee, wine and beer -- and that could be misleading. My "presence" is not who I am, rather it only reflects a small part of me and my life.

You see, it's all about _when_ I post presence updates. Usually, it's when I take a break and I'm waiting on the barista or the coffee pot. Or, it's when I get a moment to sit down and relax at night. So my presence posts often come from those moments. But as more and more of me gets [scattered across the internet](http://metasmurph.com), it would be easy to assume that a more complete picture of me is developing for all to see. Certainly, small things about me are revealed -- but do not take them to be all there is to me. 

Truth is, much of the real me -- what I do, what I achieve, what I think about -- is not "present" on the internet at all. That's because the real me is what I do _between_ "presence" posts.
